         <article> h“We were just down in the mines like we are every day, mining up some iron for the smiths.  Gronmir was just picking away at this vein of iron and all of a sudden the whole wall started shakin.’  Well the first thing we thought was that we were about to have a cave in, but in the middle of it the wall started to grow these glowing blue eyes and started to growl at us.  I know it sounds crazy but it sounded like a big angry bear was gargling gravel.  Now just as quick as you can imagine that wall grew an arm and started pulling itself out of the wall.  Gronmir screamed and dropped his pick, running down the tunnel yelling that the mine was trying to kill him.  It would have been damned funny if it weren’t for the fact that I saw that thing myself and was running right at his back the whole way out.”

Horrace got spooked and started hee-ing and haw-ing then all of a sudden the ground under him caved in and he was swallowed whole by the ugliest worm thing I've ever seen. Thats when I was grabbed from behind by Sir Shen and his band of knights and they saved me(and what was left of my farm) from certain doom."

An' all a sudden tha' good fer nothin' Filkin boy come runnin' up the lane like the Furies be af'er 'im. Carry'n on an' ruttin' up me path like, y'a know? Well, I 'ad a mind ta give 'im what for, but then I seen it, y'know. Bigger'n tha Shelpie's barn i'twas. Never seen such a thing in me life, but sure as the sun rises 'twas a dragon.

Well this dragon be af'er somethin' tha's fo' sho', an' it come right up on me an' Bessy, lookin' me right in the eye an' starin' into me soul. An' I stood straight up an' told it, this be my land, and ain't no dragon gonna be takin' it from me. Well tha' ruffled 'er feathers I reckon', an' she belched out a gout of fire. Didn' know wha' to do but dive under poor Bessy. An' tha's how I ended up with all these steaks ya' see? Cooked perfect like, medium rare an' a little char on the ou'side. Bet you'll ne'er find anythin' else like it - a steak cook by an honest to gods dragon. What? The Filkin boy? Naw, had nothin' t' do with tha', I swear! Tha' dragon, well she tore 'im up when she realized she couldn' get ta me hidin' like I was under ole Bessy ya' know? Tore up tha' Filkin boy like he deserved, then crashed abou' me farm, wreckin' tha' chicken coup, gobblin' up me Cornelia, an' jus' makin' a right mess of things y'know? Well all I gots left now is these steaks ya' see? Honest to gods dragon cooked. Tell ya' what, I'll make ya' a deal - jus' 10 gold for one of these steaks. Help a poor starvin' farmer, won't ya'?

         <article> Vecna's early life was clouded in legend and contradiction. Most accounts stated that he was originally a human wizard from Oerth, although some reports claimed that he was a half-elf.[2] After having become an extremely powerful wizard and starting to fear for his own mortality, Vecna was taught by Orcus how to achieve undeath, later becoming one of the most powerful liches ever in existence.
